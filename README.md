# Sorting-visualizer
**Sorting Visualizer**
This is a sorting visualizer I created to help me comprehend the similarities between all the sorting algorithms. I decided to include 5 algorithms.
The following algorithms were included:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Insertion Sort

**Technologies Used**

HTML,
CSS,
JS

Our motive is to make easy to understand the concept of sorting algorithms through visualization.
